# Youtube_adview-in-ML
A prediction model for predicting adviews on youtube videos on the basis of  likes/dislikes , views , comments and total watch time on the basis of category with the help of normalising data and using Tree regressor

In this project we first refined our data so as to fit our needs and used it to make some graphs and heatmaps so as to get some instights into the data, than we used keraas library to train our model so as to calculate the adviews on a particular youtube video. <br><br>
